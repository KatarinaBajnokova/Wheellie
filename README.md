Wheellie

Project Structure
This project is organized into several key components, each serving a specific functional purpose:

    index.html, style.css, script.js: These files create an engaging animated advertisement using GSAP to introduce users to the Wheellie application.

    main.html, main.css, main.js: Central to the project, these files contain the main functionality of the application, featuring interactive modules and utilizing the Web Geolocation API to enhance user interaction through dynamic content based on their location.

    direction.html, direction.css, direction.js: These files are focused on showcasing advanced interactive mapping features, further demonstrating the application's capabilities.

All HTML and CSS files have been thoroughly validated to be free from errors, ensuring reliable and consistent functionality. For JS I couldn't find correctly working validation websites :(
